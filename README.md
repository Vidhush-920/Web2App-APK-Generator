Include:
  Project Title & Description: What the project does.
  
  Features: List what the app and server can do.
  
  Setup Instructions (for Android App):

    How to create and activate a virtual environment.
    How to install dependencies (pip install -r server/requirements.txt).

  Crucial: Instructions on how to install Android SDK, Gradle, and generate a keystore locally, as these are needed for the server's APK generation. Refer to the previous detailed guide.
    How to set environment variables (e.g., for ANDROID_HOME and keystore paths/passwords) locally before running the server.
    How to run the Flask server (python server/app.py).

  Connecting Android App to Server: Explain how to update the server URL in the Android app's MainActivity.kt to http://10.0.2.2:5000 (for emulator) or your local PC's IP (for physical device).
  
  Usage: How to use the app after setup.
  
  Notes/Disclaimers: Mention that the APK generation is done locally by the server and requires specific system configurations.
